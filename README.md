# denothird

A package list fetcher for Deno.

I think this is bad idea, but I just want to use this.

# Install

```
denoget https://denopkg.com/hashrock/denothird/denothird.ts
```

# Usage

```
denothird
// -> shows Deno thirdparty package lists

denothird search qs >> package.ts
// -> import * as qs from "https://denopkg.com/denolib/qs/index.ts";
```
